Hey World 👋,

it's Ray. I am an absolute beginner and just learning some few steps in HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript later on.

Every project in this repository was made by the instructions on The Odin Project:
https://www.theodinproject.com

Make sure to check out this website if you are new to html, css and js.

Greeting from a place which we call earth.

P.S.:
If you have any suggestion or tips and tricks which I can rely on in my further steps in development, feel free to write me a message.
